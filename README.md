# CPP-Game---Asteroid-Blaster
## A simple 2D game where you fly a spaceship destroying asteroids

I made this game in SFML as a fun exercise to get more comfortable with C++. 

### Compiling Instructions
To compile the game, user must have SFML installed. It is recommended to download the zipped game folder as this folder already contains the necessary dll and game resource files. IDE configuration may need to be adjusted to ensure that SFML's include and library directories are properly linked. 

### Gameplay instructions
Press W to move the ship up

Press S to move the ship down

Press Space to fire weapon

Press Esc at any time to end game



Destroy as many asteroids as you can before running out of health. Asteroids that make it past the player causes the player to lose health.
